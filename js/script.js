 * `getRandomQuote`

 */

Create a function named printQuote.

You will program the printQuote function to perform three tasks: call the getRandomQuote function, 
use the returned quote object to build a string of HTML and quote properties, then use that string to display a random quote in the browser.

In the body of the printQuote function, create a variable to store a random quote object from the getRandomQuote() function.

Create another variable to store the HTML string. Set it equal to a string containing two <p> elements. 
Use this code snippet as a guide for what the HTML string should look like at this point:


<p class="quote"> A random quote </p>
<p class="source"> quote source
  <span class="citation"> quote citation </span>
  <span class="year"> quote year </span>
</p>

    <p class="quote"> ${quoteObj.quote} </p>
    <p class="source"> ${quoteObj.source}

  }
  if (quoteObj.year) {//Check if year exists
